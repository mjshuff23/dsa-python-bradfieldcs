# A deque(double-ended queue), is an ordered collection of items similar to the queue.
#  - It has two ends, a front and a rear, and the items remain positioned in the collection.
#  - What makes a deque different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items.
#      - New items can be added at either the front or the rear.
#      - Existing items can be removed from either end.
#  - This hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a
#    single data structure.
